## Getting Started

Clone this project and the [directoryAppCore project](https://github.com/clariechek/directoryAppCore) into the same directory.
Then, run the application.

The application has a search field where you can enter the path of the directory you would like to search.
The Reload button updates the search path. It also updates the display if there were any changes to the same directory.

Below is a demo of the application:
